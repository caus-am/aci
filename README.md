Ancestral Causal Inference (ACI): 
=====================================================
Ancestral Causal Inference (ACI) is a logic-based causal discovered algorithm for causal systems with latent confounders and no feedback.
You can find a short introduction <a href="https://github.com/caus-am/aci/blob/master/INTRO.md"> here </a>.

ACI is described in more detail in the NIPS 2016 publication:

ACI uses the Answer Set Programming solver clingo 4, also available at <a href="https://github.com/potassco/clingo"> https://github.com/potassco/clingo </a>

Practical information
---------------------
Installation instructions can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/caus-am/aci/blob/master/INSTALL"> INSTALL </a> file.

The repository is organized as follows:
- The ASP folder contains various Answer Set Programming encodings of causal discovery algorithms.
- The R folder contains most of the code (surprisingly, in R).
- The experiments folder contains various Matlab code that we used to plot the evaluation graphs, or run the experiments on the Sachs2005 dataset.

In the NIPS 2016 paper we refer to this implementation as HEJ (from the surnames of the authors).
